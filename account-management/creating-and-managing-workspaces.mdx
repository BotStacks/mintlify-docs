Workspaces in BotStacks provide dedicated environments for managing and developing Bot Stacks, facilitating collaboration among team members, and organizing resources effectively within your organization. 

This guide outlines the steps to create and manage workspaces efficiently.

## Creating a Workspace

In your dashboard, click on your workspace name on the left sidebar to open the dropdown menu. From the dropdown, click the 'Create New Workspace' option.

When you create a Workspace, a window will pop up asking you to enter a name for your workspace. You can change this name later without affecting your workspace in any way, it's just for your reference on the dashboard.

## Managing the Workspaces

To switch between different workspaces, simply click on the desired  workspace name located on the left sidebar of the dashboard.
