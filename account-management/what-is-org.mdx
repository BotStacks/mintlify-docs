title: 'What is a Organization?'
---

An organization within BotStacks serves as your overarching account structure. It represents the highest level of organization within the platform and is tied to billing and administrative functions. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

### Account Level

The organization is where all activities related to billing, subscription management, and overall account administration occur. It serves as the umbrella under which all other elements of your BotStacks usage reside.

### Billing and Subscription

Your organization determines the billing structure and subscription plan for your BotStacks usage. This includes payment details, upgrade options, and any associated costs for additional features or usage tiers.

### Administrative Control

As the highest level of organization, it grants administrative control over all associated workspaces and users. This includes the ability to manage permissions, access levels, and other administrative tasks.

### Scope of Access

While an organization encompasses multiple workspaces, it provides a centralized point of access for managing and overseeing all associated bot stacks, users and resources.
