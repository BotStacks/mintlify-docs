A workspace is a contained environment within your organization where specific Assistants, collaborations and interactions take place. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

### Project Environment

Each workspace represents a distinct environment where Assistants are created, developed, and managed. It serves as a dedicated space for organizing and iterating on chat applications, prototypes and related assets.

### User and Assistant Cohesion

Within a workspace, all users and AI assistants operate within the same context. This means that any collaborators, team members or AI assistants associated with a particular workspace are accessible and manageable within that workspace's environment.

### Collaboration Hub

Workspaces facilitate collaboration by providing a shared platform for team members to contribute, collaborate, and communicate on Bot stacks. This includes features such as version control, commenting and real-time editing to streamline the development process.

### Isolation and Security

Workspaces offer a level of isolation and security, ensuring that Bot stacks and data within one workspace are compartmentalized from those in other workspaces. This helps maintain privacy, confidentiality and Bot stacks integrity.
