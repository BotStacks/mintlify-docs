## Overview

The assistant API allows any application to chat with an AI assistant created on the BotStacks platform using HTTP calls.

## Conversation state

The state of the conversation is maintained and persisted within BotStacks via the unique botstack assistant ID and user ID combination.
Due to the nature of the assistant conversation and the need to maintain the conversations state, this HTTP endpoint is not a stateless endpoint.

In order to start a new conversation, simply omit the userId property from the request body. This will begin a new conversation as a new user and return the userId as part of the response.
