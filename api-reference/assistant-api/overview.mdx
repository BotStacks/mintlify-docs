## Overview

The BotStacks assistant API allows any application to use HTTP calls to interact with an AI assistant created on the BotStacks platform.

## Conversation state

The conversation state is maintained and persisted within BotStacks through a unique combination of the botstack assistant ID and user ID. Due to the nature of assistant conversations and the need to preserve state, this HTTP endpoint is not stateless.

To initiate a new conversation, simply exclude the user ID property from the request body. This will start a fresh conversation as a new user and return the user ID as part of the response.
