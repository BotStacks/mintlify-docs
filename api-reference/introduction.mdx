## Welcome

Our API layer relies on GraphQL. You can access all GraphQL API documentation in the playground. Look for the “Docs” and “Schema” tabs on the right edge of the playground.

## Security

For every request, an API Key must be included in the request header. If your query or mutation requires a user context, you’ll also need a bearer token passed as the Authorization header.

### API Key

All requests must include the X-Api-Key header. The API Key can be found in the dashboard
for a particular project.

```json
{
  "X-Api-Key": API_KEY
}
```

### Logging in

To log in, use the `login` mutation. A successful login returns an `Auth` object containing the token.
For subsequent calls that require a user context (which is most cases), pass the token as the Bearer token in the Authorization
header.

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here"
}
```
