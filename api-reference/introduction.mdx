## Welcome

We utilize GraphQL for our API layer. All GraphQL API docs can be found in the playground. Find the
"Docs" and "Schema" tabs to the right edge of the playground.

  Peruse the gql schema and send queries and mutations in the playground!

## Security

Every request requires an API Key to be passed in the request header. If the query or mutation has a user context,
you will also need a bearer token passed as the Authorization header.

### API Key

All requests must have the X-Api-Key header. The API Key can be found in the dashboard
for a particular project.

```json
{
  "X-Api-Key": API_KEY
}
```

### Logging in

To log in, use the `login` mutation. A successful login returns an `Auth` object, including the token.
On subsequent calls that require a user context (which are most), pass the token as the Bearer token in the Authorization
header.

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here"
}
```
