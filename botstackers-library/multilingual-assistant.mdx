Implementing a Multilingual Assistant enables smooth communication for users in their preferred language. This enhances overall user satisfaction and gives your company an edge in the global arena.


## How to Enable Multilingual Responses?

If your AI model supports multiple languages, users can ask questions in their preferred language, and the assistant will respond accordingly. This multilingual capability comes standard with all assistants built on BotStacks.

## How to Set a Single Response Language
If you prefer your AI Assistant to maintain all conversations in a single language, you can specify this in the system prompt you provide to the Assistant on the LLM Node.
