## How to make your Assistant to respond in different languages?

If you're using a AI model that supports your desired language, you can ask questions in that language, and the assistant will respond accordingly in the same language. This is a default functionality of all assistants built on Botstacks.

## How to make your Assistant to respond in one single language?
If you prefer your AI Assistant to maintain all conversations in a single language, you can specify this in the system prompt you provide to the Assistant on the LLM Node.
