### 1. Task

The task is essentially what you want the AI model to do or provide. It's like giving it a job description. By clearly stating the task, you're guiding the AI on what specific action or information you need from it. This clarity is crucial because it sets the direction for the interaction, ensuring that the AI's responses are relevant and aligned with your objectives.

Providing a clear task ensures that the AI model understands the user's intent and delivers relevant responses.

### 2. Context

Context provides the background information necessary for the AI to generate accurate responses. It establishes the setting for the conversation and helps the AI grasp the user’s situation or needs.


<Card 
  title="Example Prompt" >
    Assist customers with inquiries about a new software update.
</Card>


### 3. Exemplar

An exemplar is like providing examples or samples of the desired responses. It helps the AI understand what you're expecting from it by showing specific instances of what a correct or appropriate response looks like. 

This can be particularly helpful in guiding the AI to provide more accurate and relevant outputs.


<Card

    Here are few examples on how your responses should look:

    `Question:` What are the plans Botstack Offers?

    `Answer:` Botstacks offers 3 plans -- Starter, Pro, and Pro+.
</Card>


### 4. Persona

Persona refers to the personality or character that the AI adopts in its responses. It's like defining the AI's demeanor or style of communication. 

While not always necessary, aligning the persona with the intended interaction can enhance user engagement and make the conversation more enjoyable and relatable for users.

    Respond as though you are a reliable and professional Customer Support Agent with 10 years of experience.
</Card>


### 5. Format

Format refers to the structure, grammar, syntax, and phrasing of the prompt. A well-formatted prompt is easier for the AI to understand and interpret accurately. 

Clear and concise language, proper grammar, correct syntax, and consistent formatting are crucial when prompting the AI to ensure it processes instructions effectively and provides appropriate responses.

### 6. Tone


Tone reflects the attitude or emotional expression conveyed in the prompt. It sets the mood of the interaction and influences how the AI responds. While tone may not always be explicitly specified, it can be implied through the choice of words and phrasing. 

Tailoring the tone to match the desired user experience can enhance engagement and make the conversation more enjoyable for users, improving overall impression of your brand.

    Maintain a polite and professional tone, using formal language and expressing empathy towards customers concerns.

<Tip>Not all prompts may contain every component, but the `Task` is essential. `Context` and `Exemplars` are vital for clarity, while `Persona`, `Format` and `Tone` elevate the user experience.</Tip>
