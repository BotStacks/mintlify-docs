## BotStack

A BotStack represents one assistant. When you visit the dashboard, you'll find a list of all your BotStacks.

### There are two ways to create a BotStack:

1. Create a new BotStack from scratch.
2. Use a template.

This guide is intended to walk you through the process of creating a new botstack from scratch. If you prefer using templates, simply select the template you want from the dashboard.

### To create a new bot stack from scratch:

In your dashboard, click on the "Create new BotStack" in the top row, just above your list of BotStacks.

When you create a new BotStack, a pop up window will ask you to enter a name for your BotStack. You can change this name later without affecting your assistant in any way; it's just for your reference on the dashboard.

Once you've created the BotStack, you'll be taken to the Sequence Studio, where you'll start building your AI Assistant.

Now you can proceed to the next chapter, which covers how to add your own data to the Brain Vault so the assistant has additional context to answer your users questions.
