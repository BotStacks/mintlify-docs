Now that you have tested your assistant, it's time to deploy it to your website.

## Publishing the Bot Stack
All the changes you have made so far are stored in your account as a draft. In order to deploy your assistant, you first have to publish it to your draft.

Click the 'Publish' button at the top right of your screen. This will publish your draft to the live version.

Once you have customized the appearance of your assistant, copy the code snippet and paste it before the closing `</body>` tag on all of the pages on your website where you want the assistant to appear.
