After creating a Bot Stack (also known as an Assistant), you can customize it to use your own data by uploading URLs, documents, or text files to the Knowledge Base.

<Tip> Each piece of data you add to the Knowledge Base is called a Knowledge Source.</Tip>


### Here's How to Add Data to the Knowledge Base:

After creating the Bot Stack (or Assistant), you'll be taken to the Assistant Designer. 


1. Navigate to the `content` page.

2. Go to the `Knowledge Base` menu.

3. Click the `Add Data Source` button at the top right corner. Then upload URLs, documents and text files as needed to enhance your assistant's capabilities.

Once you've added the data sources, your assistant will use the provided information to respond to question using Large Language Models (LLMs) like Chat-GPT, Gemini, or Claude.

<Note> There is a 50MB file limit per upload. </Note>


### Preview the Knowledge Base:

After adding your data sources, click on the `Preview` option at the top right corner.

This lets you ask the assistant questions to see how it responds using the information provided in the Knowledge Base.

If you find that the assistant's responses are not meeting your expectations, you can improve them by adding more accurate data to the Knowledge Base and adjusting settings on the knowledge base page.

Once you're satisfied with the results, proceed to the next chapter, which covers conversational flow.
