After creating a BotStack (also known as an assistant), you can customize it to use your own data by uploading URLs, documents, or text files to the Brain Vault.

<Tip>
  Each piece of data you add to the Brain Vault is called a Knowledge Source.
</Tip>

### Here's How to Add Data to the Brain Vault:

After creating the BotStack (or assistant), you'll be taken to the Sequence Studio.

1. Click the book icon in the lower left corner of the studio.

2. Click the `Add source` button at the top right corner. Then upload URLs, documents and text files as needed to enhance your assistant's capabilities. You can also crawl your entire website
to automatically grab all the urls as sources.

Once you've added the data sources, your assistant will use the provided information to respond to question using Large Language Models (LLMs) like Chat-GPT, Gemini, or Claude.

<Note> There is a 50MB file limit per upload. </Note>

### Preview the Brain Vault:

After adding your data sources, click on the `Preview` option at the top right corner.

This lets you ask the assistant questions to see how it responds using the information provided in the Brain Vault.

If you find that the assistant's responses are not meeting your expectations, you can improve them by adding more accurate data to the Brain Vault and adjusting settings on the Brain Vault page.

Once you're satisfied with the results, proceed to the next chapter, which covers conversational flow.
