We are stoked to announce we've added knowledge base support to our AI assistant designer.

### What does this mean?

You can now add sources via url, custom text, and file upload. Paired with an LLM, you can get answers to
user's questions related to your custom domain.

### What can I build?

-- Provide answers for typical user questions by adding the URL of your FAQ's page

-- Got an update announcement kinda like this one? Add it and now your assistant can share the awesome news.

-- Answer complex questions by adding your documentation urls.

-- Upload your customer support prompts to have your assistant answer the questions instead of fielding a support phone call.

### How can I build this?

Log in to your BotStacks dashboard and go to the bot stack you wish to add the knowledge base to. Click the book icon in the top right.
From there you can add your sources to build out your knowledge base. Don't forget to test your knowledge base by clicking the "Preview" button in the header.
After you've created your sources, do back to the canvas, find an LLM node, select it, and check the "Use knowledge base" option. Easy-peasy.
