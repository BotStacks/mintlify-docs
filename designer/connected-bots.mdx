You can connect multiple external bots from providers such as AWS Lex, Google DialogFlow, IBM Watson, Voiceflow, and more.
Connection to these providers can be found under Settings -> Manage Keys.

Within the designer, you can view all your connected bots in one place. Just find the button labeled "Connected bots" in the top-right of your screen.

You can also resync your bots via the Sync button just to the right.
