/>


### Step 4

Obtain your App Token by going to the `Bot` page from the left sidebar.

Discord won't show the token for the first time so you have to click on `Reset Token` to access your token

### Step 5

After you have reset your token, discord will show the app token. 

Copy the `token` and keep it somewhere safe because discord only shows the token one time after you reset.
