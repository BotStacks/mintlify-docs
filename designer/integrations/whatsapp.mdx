### 4) Generate Access Token

Now you have to enter your `Permanent WhatsApp Token` and `WhatsApp Phone Number ID` on Botstacks

You can find the `Phone Number ID` from the **API Setup** page on Meta Developer dashboard.

src="/images/integrations/whatsapp/15.png"
/>

<Tip>Phone Number ID is different from your phone number. The phone number ID will be 15 digits and your phone number will be 10 digits</Tip>

You can get your `Permanent WhatsApp Token` from [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/get-started#1--acquire-an-access-token-using-a-system-user-or-facebook-login)

<img 
height="500"  
src="/images/integrations/whatsapp/16.png"
/>

<Warning> You have to use your `Permanent WhatsApp Token` because the Temporary Token shown on **API Setup** page will expire whenever you refresh your browser tab. </Warning>

Once you have added your `Permanent WhatsApp Token` and `WhatsApp Phone Number ID` on Botstacks, it will show you as **Connected** on the Integrations page.
