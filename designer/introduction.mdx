## What is it?

The designer is your viewport into building your AI assistant. It consists of:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Nodes">
    Nodes are logic blocks that are responible for taking one or more inputs and
    transforming them into an output.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Channels">
    Channels are connectors between nodes that represent the flow of an AI
    workflow
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Node inputs

Each node is given a slug in the form of `{nodeType}-{index}` that can be referenced from nodes directly next in the chain.

In the example below, we are referencing both the routing node and the read node within the LLM node. The output of each of those nodes (routing-0 and read-0) will be directly interpolated in the user prompt.

<Note>
  This is a common use case of passing chat history to chatGPT, given that the
  read node is using the chat_history variable
</Note>

### Conversation flow

A conversation flows from node to node via the channels that connect them. For more advanced use-cases, you may have multiple outputs
for a given node. At the point where a flow diverges, you will have two separate workflows running simultaneously
in an async manner.

## Publishing

When creating your AI assistant within the designer, you are editing a draft version of the assistant. That means that
any changes you make will not effect your "live" version. In order to commit your changes, you must publish your changes.

You can publish your changes by clicking the "Publish" button in the top-right corner of the designer.

<Note>Using the sandbox will use the draft version of the assistant.</Note>
