The bot stack node initiates a sub conversation by connecting to a multiple external AI agent providers.
![Bot Stack Node](/images/bot-stack-node.png)

A bot stack node can be used anywhere within a chain. Once the conversation flow reaches a bot stack node, the underlying
conversation via the selected third party agent takes over. When the session is ended from the external provider,
the conversation continues within the flow.

On initially reaching a bot stack node in the conversational flow, a request is sent to each of the external bots listed in the node.
Upon receiving from each of the bots, the bot with the highest confidence score is chosen and remains the selected agent until the bot
stack conversation is ended.

- `Bots`: The selected external bots to which to initiate a sub-conversation. The list of available bots is populated from the aggregation
  of all the external provider bots. See [Connected bots](/designer/connected-bots) for more details..
