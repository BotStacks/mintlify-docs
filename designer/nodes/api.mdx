The API node allows you to connect with external services using RESTful API calls. You can specify the endpoint (URL) of the external service you want to communicate with.

Additionally, you can include custom headers to provide necessary information for the request. When making POST, PUT, or PATCH requests, you'll have to format the data in JSON within the body section. This enables you to send and receive data seamlessly between Botstacks and external services, facilitating actions like creating bookings or accessing information from third-party platforms.
