The bot node initiates a sub conversation by connecting to a single external AI agent provider.
![Bot Node](/images/bot-node.png)

A bot node can be used anywhere within a chain. Once the conversation flow reaches a bot node, the underlying
conversation via the selected third party agent takes over. When the session is ended from the external provider,
the conversation continues within the flow.

- `Bot`: The selected external bot to which to initiate a sub-conversation. The list of available bots is populated from the aggregation
  of all the external provider bots. See [Connected bots](/designer/connected-bots) for more details.
