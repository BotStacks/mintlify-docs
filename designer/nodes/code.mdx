The JavaScript Node allows you to implement more advanced logic into their AI Assistant. It's useful for handling complex tasks that require programming expertise.

You can access conversation variables within the JavaScript Node using the `variables` object. 

<Tip>For Example, you can count the number of messages from a user using a simple code snippet.</Tip> 

It's important to note that all variables retrieved are in string format, so you should convert them to numbers using `parseInt` for arithmetic operations. 

Unlike some other systems, there's no need to explicitly pass variables into the JavaScript Node, they're automatically accessible.

Additionally, you can set custom variables within your JavaScript code using the provided **saveVariable** function. 

### Return paths

The JavaScript Node offers default routes like `Fallback` and `Error` to handle different outcomes of the code execution. 

The `Error` route handles exceptions like syntax errors, while the `Fallback` route executes if the code runs successfully. 

You can also define custom routing logic by using return statements to specify alternative routes.

When you modify the code to include or remove return statements, the node updates on the canvas to reflect the possible output paths. This flexibility allows you to create diverse conversation flows tailored to your application's needs.
