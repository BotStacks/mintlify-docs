The Condition Node  allows you to create different paths in a conversation based on specific conditions. 

This means you can make your assistant respond differently depending on the situation.

Think of conditions like a cause and effect: "**If** this happens, **then** do that."


<Tip>
Example:
- **If** I wake up early, **then** I will go to the gym. 
- **If** I am hungry, **then** I will eat.
</Tip>

## Adding Conditional Paths
The Condition Node can have multiple condition paths. These paths let your assistant handle various scenarios. 

To create a new path, click on the **+ Add Condition** option.

### Why Use Conditional Paths?
Using conditional paths makes your assistant more dynamic and responsive. 
Instead of giving the same response every time, your assistant can provide tailored replies based on the user's input or other variables.


## Building a Condition
Building a condition involves setting up rules that determine which path the conversation will take. 

The Condition Node gives you the flexibility to check multiple criteria using two main elements:
- Variable
- Logic Group

### Variable
A variable is a piece of information that your assistant knows or collects during the conversation. 
You can use variables to check against specific values and determine the next step in the conversation.

Here’s how to work with variables:
1. **Define a Variable:** Choose a variable from your variables list
2. **Set the Condition:** Select a condition to check (e.g., contains, greater than, less than).
3. **Define the Value:** Input the value you want to compare against the variable. (This value is plain text you define, on the above image you can see we have entered the value as **18**).

<Tip>
Example:
- **Variable:** time_of_day
- **Condition:** is
- **Value:** morning

This setup will check if the variable **time_of_day** is equal to morning.
</Tip>


### Logic Group
A Logic Group allows you to combine multiple conditions using logical operators **AND** and **OR**. This helps create more complex and specific conditions.

- **AND**: All conditions in the group must be true for the path to be taken.
- **OR**: If any condition in the group is true, the path will be taken.

/>

<Tip>

**Condition 1:** time_of_day is morning

**Condition 2:** weather is sunny

Using **AND**, both conditions must be true.

Using **OR**, either condition can be true.
</Tip>


## Evaluation
When the Condition Node is reached, it evaluates the set conditions against the variables. 
If the variable matches the defined value according to the condition, the corresponding path is activated.

<Tip>
Example:
- **Variable**: day
- **Condition**: is
- **Value**: monday

If the day is monday, the path designed for monday responses will be followed.
</Tip>


## Otherwise Path
The Condition Node includes a default "**Otherwise Path**". This path is used when none of the specified conditions are met. 
It ensures that your assistant always has a response, even if the conditions you set aren’t fulfilled.

### Why Use the Otherwise Path?
The Otherwise Path provides a fallback option, ensuring that your assistant doesn't get stuck without a response. 
It makes your assistant more robust and able to handle unexpected situations gracefully.

<Tip>
Example:

If no conditions are met, the assistant might say, "**I didn't quite understand that. Can you tell me more?**"
</Tip>
