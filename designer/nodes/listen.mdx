The Listen Node is like an attentive listener during a conversation. It pauses the flow of the conversation, waiting for the user input. Once the user sends a message, the conversation resumes, and the assistant processes the input.

This node helps create interactive experiences by allowing the assistant to respond to user input. 

In essence, it's the point where the assistant stops to hear what the user has to say before moving forward in the conversation flow.
