The read node is used to input variables into nodes.
![Read Node](/images/read-node.png)

A read node does not have any inputs and is used to solely insert variables to be interpolated into the output node.
The connected node can reference the variable by either the node slug (ex. `read-0`) or the variable name (ex. `last_utterance`)

- `Variable`: The name of the variable to read. You must have already defined a variable. See (Variables)[/designer/variables] for more details.
