The routing node is a form of basic intent classification and routing based on said classification.

A routing node has as many outputs as added intents. During processing, a single intent will be chosen, and, thus, will continue down the selected chain.

See [Intents](/designer/intents)

<Note>Routing nodes use AI tokens</Note>
