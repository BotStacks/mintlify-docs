The set node is used to save variables for use later in the conversation.
![Set Node](/images/set-node.png)

A set node does not have any outputs and is processed before any other nodes. For example, if you
have an llm node you can output to both a set node and a text input node. The set node will always
be processed first and the variable selected will be set. That means in the text input node, you can immediately
"read" that variable, avoiding any race conditions.

- `Action`: The action is how the variable is set. The two options are "Append" and "Set", which either appends the input to the existing value or overrides any existing value, respectively.
- `Variable`: The name of the variable to set. You must have already defined a variable. See [Variables](/designer/variables) for more details.
