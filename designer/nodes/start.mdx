The start node represents the beginning of the conversation. It is triggered by a mention or from the initial message in a DM.

The input provided that initially started the conversation is immediately passed onto all the start nodes outputs.

<Note>
  Within a DM, if a conversation has been ended, the next user message will
  start the conversation over again.
