## AI Assistant Designer

The AI assistant designer is an integral part of our platform. With it, you can build out your assistants in a drag-and-drop interface, connecting AI responses with LLMs and existing platforms.

## Deploying your AI assistants

To see your assistants in the real world, you can do this in three different ways: a pre-configured web assistant widget, within a your own application using our chat SDKs and UIKits, or a data-only solution using our GraphQL API.

    With the web assistant widget, you can copy-paste a code snippet onto your
    html page, to get your assistant directly in front of users.
