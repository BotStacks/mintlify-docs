## AI Assistant Designer

The AI assistant designer is an integral part of our platform. It allows you to build assistants and chatbots using our drag-and-drop interface, seamlessly connecting AI responses with large language models (LLMs) and integrating them with existing platforms.

## Deploying your AI assistants

You can deploy your assistants in three different ways: 
1. Using a pre-configured web assistant widget.
2. Integrating them within your own application with our chat SDKs and UI kits.
3. Utilizing a data-only solution via our GraphQL API.

See below for more details.
