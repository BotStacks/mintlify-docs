### Avatar
Our Avatar component renders an image for a given URL in a bordered circle at the specified size. This is utilized in our larger components to render user Avatars (as the component name claims).

There are a few overload methods for this component dependent on your usage.

```Kotlin
Avatar(user = message.user)
Avatar(url = chat.displayImage, size = AvatarSize.Large, chat = true)
Avatar(type = AvatarType.Channel(listOf(chat.displayImage)))
Avatar(type = AvatarType.User(user))
Avatar sizing resolves around two defined sizes, with the ability to define a custom size.
```

`AvatarSize.Small` - renders at 50 dp

`AvatarSize.Large` - renders at 100 dp

`AvatarSize.Custom(val dp: Dp)` - renders at specified size

### Badge
Our Badge component renders a `badge` that can either take in a `Int` count or a `String` label. This is utilized in the MessageList component serving as the date separators, in the ChatList component to show unread counts, and in the ChannelSettingsView for displaying admins.

There are a few overload methods for this component dependent on your usage and level of customization needs.

```Kotlin
Badge(count = 1) // renders a Badge with the number 1
Badge(count = 101) // renders a Badge with 99+
Badge(label = "Admin")
