## Getting Started

In order to display any of the UI components and access chat data, you must first initialize the SDK
and log in as a chat user.

### Initialization

In your Application class, call BotStacksChat.shared.setup with your API key. You can obtain your API key from
the [Botstacks Dashboard](https://dashboard.botstacks.ai/settings). If you don't yet have one, you can [create one for FREE](https://dashboard.botstacks.ai)!

If you don't have an Application class, [create one](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Understanding-the-Android-Application-Class).

```Swift
BotStacksChat.shared.setup(context, apiKey)
```

Note, you can optionally delay load and later call BotStacksChat.shared.load to load BotStacks in whatever
load sequence you wish.

### Logging in

Nearly all functionality is within the context of a chat user. That said, you must first be logged in as a chat
user in order to appropriately display the UI components.

To log in, call the `login` function prior to displaying any UI components. Below is an example of How
to accomplish this.

```Kotlin
fun doLogin() {
  BotStacksChat.shared.login(accessToken, userId, username, displayName, profilePicture)
  if (BotStacksChat.shared.isUserLoggedIn) {
    // handle login view change
  }
}
```

### Giphy and Google Maps rendering support

If you want Giphy support and/or Google Maps rendering support you will need API keys for those services as well.
