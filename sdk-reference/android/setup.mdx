## Getting Started

In order to display any of the UI components and access chat data, you must first initialize the SDK
and log in as a chat user.

### Step 1. Initialization

In your Application class, call `BotStacksChat.shared.setup` with your API key. You can obtain your API key from
the [Botstacks Dashboard](https://dashboard.botstacks.ai/settings). If you don't yet have one, you can [create one for FREE](https://dashboard.botstacks.ai)!

If you don't have an Application class, [create one](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Understanding-the-Android-Application-Class).

```Kotlin
class App : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
+       BotStacksChat.shared.setup(
+           context = this,
+           apiKey = "your-api-key"
+       )
    }
}
```

Note, you can optionally delay load and later call `BotStacksChat.shared.load` to load BotStacks in whatever load sequence you wish.

If you'd like Giphy support in your chats, send your Giphy API key during `setup`.

```Kotlin
BotStacksChat.shared.setup(
    context = this,
    apiKey = "your_botstacks_api_key",
    giphyApiKey = "your_giphy_api_key"
)
```

### Step 2. Logging in

Nearly all functionality is within the context of a chat user. That said, you must first be logged in as a chat
user in order to appropriately display the UI components.

To log in, call the `login` function prior to displaying any UI components. Below is an example of how
to accomplish this.

```Kotlin
val composeScope = rememberCoroutineScope()
composeScope.launch {
    BotStacksChat.shared.login(
        "user-identifier",
        "username"
    ) // optionally pass displayName and picture
    if (BotStacksChat.shared.isUserLoggedIn) {
        // handle logged in state change
    }
}
```

### Step 3. Render the UI

The BotStacks UI Kit uses Jetpack Compose. You can add it to any `NavHost` by rendering inside an `BotStacksThemeEngine` and adding the `BotStacksChatController`. Customization controls for the Theme Engine are described below.

```Kotlin
BotStacksThemeEngine {
    NavHost(navController = navController, startDestination = "splash") {
        val openChat = {
            navController.navigate("chats")
        }
        composable("splash") {
            Splash(openChat = openChat, openLogin = {
                navController.navigate("login")
            })
        }
        composable("login") {
            Login(openChat)
        }

        composable("chats") {
           BotStacksChatController(onLogout = { navController.navigate("login") })
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4. Push Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)

For push notifications via FCM, just pass your push token to BotStacks

```Kotlin
BotStacksChat.registerFCMToken(token)
```
