## Overview

You can theme your BotStacks UI kit by passing in a theme to `BotStacksChatContext`. The theme supports fonts, colors and things like bubble border radius and image sizes.

### Provide a Theme to BotStacksChat

```Kotlin
val customTheme = remember {
    makeTheme(this)
}
BotStacksChatContext(theme) {
    // App Content
}
```

### Colors, Fonts and Assets

You can provide your own color themes to the theme object with a wide array of parameters. The UI kit uses both a light and a dark theme so provide both, as well as Fonts and Assets. Here's an example makeTheme function that customizes fonts, colors and assets used by the SDK



```Kotlin
fun makeTheme(context: Context): Theme {
    val primary = Color(0xFF92C748)
    val fontName = GoogleFont("Nunito")

    val provider = GoogleFont.Provider(
            providerAuthority = "com.google.android.gms.fonts",
            providerPackage = "com.google.android.gms",
            certificates = array.com_google_android_gms_fonts_certs
    )
    val fontFamily = FontFamily(
            Font(googleFont = fontName, fontProvider = provider)
    )
    val app = { size: TextUnit, weight: FontWeight ->
        FontStyle(size, weight, fontFamily)
    }

    return Theme().apply {
        light = Colors(
                true,
                primary = primary,
                senderBubble = Color(0xFFC0D99E),
                senderUsername = primary
        )
        dark = Colors(
                false,
                primary = primary,
                senderBubble = Color(0xFFC0D99E),
                senderText = Color(0xFF202127),
                senderUsername = primary
        )
        fonts = Fonts(
                title = app(22.sp, FontWeight.ExtraBold),
                title2 = app(20.sp, FontWeight.SemiBold),
                title3 = app(15.sp, FontWeight.SemiBold),
                headline = app(13.sp, FontWeight.Bold),
                body = app(14.sp, FontWeight.Normal),
                caption = app(12.sp, FontWeight.Normal)
        )
        assets = Assets(
                drawable.pp_icon,
                emptyChannels = EmptyScreenConfig(
                        drawable.empty_channels,
                        "You haven't joined any channels yet"
                ),
                emptyChat = EmptyScreenConfig(
                        drawable.empty_chat,
                        "Your friends are ***dying*** to see you"
                ),
                emptyChats = EmptyScreenConfig(
                        drawable.empty_threads,
                        "You haven't added to any chats yet"
                ),
                emptyAllChannels = EmptyScreenConfig(
                        drawable.empty_all_channels,
                        "It's dead in here"
                )

        )
    }
}
```
