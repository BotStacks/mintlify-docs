## Welcome

We're excited to get started! Our SDKs and UIKits allow you to build a feature-rich chat experience
very quickly. Both below and in the nav you will find the SDKs and UIKits that we offer. If
we don't have what you need, we'd love to hear what stack your building with. Pop over to our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5kwyQCz3zZ)
and let us know. You can help form our roadmap! In the meantime, you can utilize our [GraphQL API](/api-reference/introduction) to interact with
our data.

## API Key

With each of the SDKs, you will only need to grab your api key from the dashboard. Just go to Settings -> General and click
"Copy" next to your API Key.

## AI Assistants

<Note>
  Any AI assistants you've already built or ones you plan to build with our
  designer are treated as special users already integrated into your chat
  environment. Once your SDK is set up, you can immediately DM or chat with them
  in public or private channels.
