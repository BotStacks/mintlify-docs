description: Set up your SDK for user

## Getting Started

In order to display any of the UI components and access chat data, you must first initialize the SDK
and log in as a chat user.

### Initialization

In your app delegate, or anywhere else you put your startup logic, initialize the BotStacksChat SDK

```Swift
BotStacksChat.setup(apiKey: apiKey)
```

Note, you can optionally delay load and later call BotStacksChat.shared.load to load BotStacks in whatever
load sequence you wish.

### Logging in

Nearly all functionality is within the context of a chat user. That said, you must first be logged in as a chat
user in order to appropriately display the UI components.

To log in, call the `login` function prior to displaying any UI components. Below is an example of How
to accomplish this.

```Swift
@IBAction func loginToBotStacksChat() {
  self.loading = true
  Task.detached {
    do {
      let loggedIn = try await BotStacksChat.shared.login(
            accessToken: nil,
            userId: id,
            username: nickname,
            picture: picture,
            displayName: name
          )
      if loggedIn {
        displayBotStacksChat()
      }
    } catch let err {
      print("error logging in \(err)")
    }
  }
}
```
