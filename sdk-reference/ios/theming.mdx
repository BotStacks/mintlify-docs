## Overview

You can theme your BotStacksChat UI by passing in a theme to BotStacksChat any time
before displaying the UI. The theme supports fonts, colors and things like bubble border
radius and image sizes.

### Provide a Theme to BotStacksChat

```Swift
BotStacksChat.set(theme: Theme())
```

### Customize colors

You can provide your own color themes to the theme object with a wide array of parameters.
The UI kit uses both a light and a dark theme, so provide both.

```Swift
BotStacksChat.set(theme:
  Theme(
    light: Colors(
      primary: .blue,
      background: .white
    ),
    dark: Colors(
      primary: .blue,
      background: .black
    )
  )
)
```

### Customize fonts

The UI kit uses the same Font styles as iOS. 

You can provide your own Fonts object to customize
those fonts:

```Swift
BotStacksChat.set(theme:
  Theme(
    fonts: Fonts(
      title: .app(22, .black),
      title2: .app(20, .heavy),
      title2Regular: .app(20),
      title3: .app(16, .heavy),
      headline: .app(16, .bold),
      body: .app(14),
      caption: .app(12)
    )
  )
)
```

### Customize assets

There are customizable assets and text that you can use in your UI Kit as well. These are only applicable if
utilizing `BotStacksChatView`.
Most importantly is the default image you want to use for groups.

```Swift
BotStacksChat.set(theme:
  Theme(
    assets: Assets(group: Image("my-group-placeholder"))
  )
)
```

To set empty screen images:

```Swift
BotStacksChat.set(theme:
    Theme(
      emptyChannels: EmptyScreenConfig(
        image: Image("empty-channels"),
        caption: "You haven't joined any channels yet"),
      emptyChat: EmptyScreenConfig(
        image: Image("empty-chat"),
        caption: "Your friends are ***dying*** to see you"
      ),
      emptyThreads: EmptyScreenConfig(
        image: Image("empty-threads"),
        caption: "You haven't added to any threads yet"),
      emptyAllChannels: EmptyScreenConfig(
        image: Image("empty-all-channels"),
        caption: "It's dead in here"
      )
    )
  )
```
