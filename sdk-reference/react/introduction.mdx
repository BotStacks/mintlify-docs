## Overview

The React UI Kit is a collection of elegant React components backed by the JavaScript SDK. These components empower engineers to build an immersive chat environment.

## How to use these docs

In the navigation, you’ll find various components exported by the UI Kit. Each component falls into one of two categories: 

- Data aware: These components manage data, including fetching, creating, and deleting data within the component. All of this functionality is already handled.
- NOT data aware: These components are purely UI-based. While they are often used within data-aware components, we’ve exported them separately for your convenience.

## Get started

### Install the UI Kit

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @botstacks/chat-react
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @botstacks/chat-react
```

</CodeGroup>

### Add to your project

To utilize the SDK and its data storage and API layer, wrap your chat-related code with `BotStacksChatProvider`.  It’s best to place this provider near the root of your component tree. 

Here’s a simple example: 



```tsx app.tsx
import { BotStacksChatProvider } from '@botstacks/chat-react';

export const App = () => (
  <BotStacksChatProvider apiKey={API_KEY}>
    <div>The rest of your app goes here...</div>
    <>
      <div>Any UIKit components in here will be able to use the store.</div>
      <ChannelsView />
    <>
  </BotStacksChatProvider>
);
```

<Warning>
  Make sure you only have one `BotStacksChatProvider`. Having multiple may give unexpected results.
</Warning>

### Accessing data

The React UI Kit extends the JavaScript SDK to create and set up the store automatically within the `BotStacksChatProvider`.
To enable your custom components to be reactive and data aware, you only need to wrap your components with `observer`.


This allows your components to interact with the store:

```jsx
import { observer } from 'mobx-react-lite';
import { useChat } from '@botstacks/chat-react';

export const MyCustomChatComponent = observer(() => {
  const chat = useChat();

  ...
});
```

## Quickstart

If you want to use our feature-complete UI, including routing or just simply want to give it a test
run, you can use the `BotStacksChatUI` component.

Here is a full example, using a hardcoded user to log in:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import {
  BotStacksChatProvider,
  BotStacksChatUI,
  useChat,
} from "@botstacks/chat-react";

const me = {
  user_id: "1",
  username: "luna.lovegood",
  email: "lunalovegood@hogwartz.co.uk",
  display_name: "Luna Lovegood",
};

const Chat = () => {
  const chat = useChat();
  useEffect(() => {
    chat.login(me);
  });

  return (
    <BotStacksChatUI
      onLogout={() => {
        chat.logout();
      }}
    />
  );
};

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <BotStacksChatProvider apiKey={API_KEY}>
      <Chat />
    </BotStacksChatProvider>
  );
};



```
