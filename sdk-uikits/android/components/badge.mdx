Our Badge component renders a "badge" that can accept either an `Int` count or a
`String` label. This is utilized in the [MessageList](#messagelist) component serving
as the date separators, in the [ChatList](#chatlist) component to show unread counts,
and in the [ChannelSettingsView](https://docs.botstacks.ai/sdk-reference/android/views#chatsettingsview)
for displaying admins.

There are a few overload methods for this component dependent on your usage and level of customization needed.

```Kotlin
Badge(count = 1) // renders a Badge with the number 1
Badge(count = 101) // renders a Badge with 99+
Badge(label = "Admin")
Badge(label = "Power User", backgroundColor = Color.Green)
```
