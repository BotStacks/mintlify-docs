Renders a description of a `Chat` channel in a row format.

This is utilized in the [ChannelGroup](#channelgroup) within [UserDetailsView](https://docs.botstacks.ai/sdk-reference/android/views#userdetailsview) to show channels the current user has in common with any other user.

There are a few overload methods for this component dependent on your usage and level of customization needs.

```Kotlin
ChannelRow(chat = channel)
ChannelRow(chat = channel, showMemberPreview = true)
ChannelRow(
    imageUrls = listOf(userImages),
    title = "My Favorite Channel",
    onClick = { }
)
```
