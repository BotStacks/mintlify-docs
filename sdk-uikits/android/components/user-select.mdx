A component that renders Users in a horizontally scrolling Row.

This is primarily used in [CreateChannelView](https://docs.botstacks.ai/sdk-reference/android/views#createchannelview) for showing currently selected Users and allows the ability to add more if desired.

```Kotlin
UserSelect(selectedUsers = userList, onAdd = {})
```
