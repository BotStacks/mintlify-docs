## GitHub

We use GitHub issues as a bug and feature request tracker.

If you think you've found a bug, or you have a new feature idea:

1. Please start by making sure it hasn't already been reported or fixed. You can search through existing issues and pull requests to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.
2. Then, if no duplicates exist, open an issue in the Android SDKs Repository.


## Discord
We have a [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5kwyQCz3zZ) to bring Botstacks community together. 

You can join Discord to engage in lively discussions, share your projects, and interact with developers just like you from all around the world. We'd love for you to join us!


  
<Note>If we don’t have what you need, we’d love to hear what stack your building with. Pop over to our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5kwyQCz3zZ) and let us know. </Note>
