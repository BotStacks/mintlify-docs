## GitHub

We manage our Android SDKs and UI Kits on GitHub.

If you encounter a bug or have a feature idea:

1. Please start by making sure it hasn't already been reported or fixed. You can search through existing issues and pull requests to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.
2. If needed, open a new issue in the Android SDKs Repository.

## Discord

We also have a [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5kwyQCz3zZ) to bring the Botstacks community together.

Join our Discord to engage in lively discussions, share your projects, and interact with developers just like you from all around the world.

We'd love for you to join us!

<Note>
  If we don’t have what you need, we’d love to hear what stack your building
  with. Pop over to our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/5kwyQCz3zZ)
  and let us know.{" "}
