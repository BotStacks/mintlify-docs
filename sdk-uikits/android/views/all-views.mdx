Our SDK at BotStacks includes convenience screen content views, which are essentially a couple of components working together under the hood for you generally using a `State`.

The views rely on a `State` object for driving UI and handling asynchronous updates for saving, creating, and updating. The `state` will be a required parameter on each View.

They generally can be used for the entire contents on a `screen` and are drop in capable.

Outlined below are the content views currently available and examples on how to use them.
