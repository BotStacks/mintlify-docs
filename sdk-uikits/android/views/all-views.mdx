Our SDK at BotStacks includes convenient screen content views, which are essentially multiple components working together under the hood, typically using a `State`.

The views rely on a `State` object to drive the UI and handle asynchronous updates for such tasks as saving, creating, and updating. The `state` is a required parameter on each View.

You can use these views for the entire `screen` content, and they are drop-in capable.


Below, we outline the currently available content views along with examples of how to use them.
