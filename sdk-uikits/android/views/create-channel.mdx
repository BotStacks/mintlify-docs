This is a screen content view for creating a new Channel. This has a callback to trigger navigation to selecting users for the channel. The UI for this screen can be found in [SelectChannelUsersView](https://docs.botstacks.ai/sdk-reference/android/views#selectchannelusersview).

To create the channel, call `state.create()`.

```Kotlin
val state = remember { CreateChannelState() }
CreateChannelView(state) {
    // go to pick users
}
```
