## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @botstacks/chat-sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @botstacks/chat-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Initialization

To initialize the SDK, all you need to do is set up the chat store and initialize the SDK.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up the store">
    This is separte from the initialization so that you can choose how to manage
    the store, depending on your tools and libraries.

    In the following example, `store` is just a mobx state tree.

```js
import { BotStacksChat } from "@botstacks/chat-sdk";

const store = BotStacksChat.createChatStore();
```

From here, you can `makeInspectable(store)` with `mobx-devtools-mst` if you desire.
And go on to make the store observable and create a reactive environment. See [MobX docs for more details](https://mobx.js.org/observable-state.html)
.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
```js main.js
import { BotStacksChat } from "@botstacks/chat-sdk";

BotStacksChat.init(process.env.API_KEY);

```
  </Step>
</Steps>
```
