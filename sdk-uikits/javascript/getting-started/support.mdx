## Discord

We have a [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/5kwyQCz3zZ) to bring the Botstacks community together in a rich, collaborative environment.

You can join Discord to engage in lively discussions, share your projects, and interact with developers just like you from all around the world.

We'd love for you to join us!

<Note>
  If we don’t have what you need, we’d love to hear what kind of stack your
  building. Pop over to our [Discord
  Server](https://discord.com/invite/5kwyQCz3zZ) and let us know.{" "}
