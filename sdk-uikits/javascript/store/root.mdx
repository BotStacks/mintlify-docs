The root store consists of the following structure:

- `user_repo`: Users
- `chat_repo`: Chats
- `message_repo`: Messages

### Actions

There are a few actions that exist on the root store.

    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`login`</td>
      <td>`input: LoginInput`</td>
      <td>
        Logs the provided user into the chat server. If the user doesn't yet
        exist, a new one is created. If the user does exist, the initially
        provided `uid` is used for authentication. The `uid` should be the
        unique and persisted identifier of the user within your user management
        solution.
