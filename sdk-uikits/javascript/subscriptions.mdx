## Overview

In order to create a seamless chat experience, we utilize `graphql-ws` under the hood to
set up websocket transport.

The subscriptions are initiated upon a successful login and torn down on logout.
The two subscriptions are:

- `core`: This event will contain any chat related updates. This includes any changes to groups/dms,
  users, memberships, messages, and more.
- `me`: This event occurs if the current user details changes

<Note>
  As of this time, this is purely informational. There is not yet any way to
  extend functionality.
