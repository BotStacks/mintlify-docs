## How to use these docs

In the navigation, you will see many components exported by the UI Kit. Some are data aware and some are not.
Each component will note which case it is. 

What that means:

- Data aware: The component is responsible for managing data. Meaning it fetches/creates/deletes data within
  the component. It is all already handled.
- NOT data aware: It is a pure UI component. Most often, these component are used within the data aware components,
  but we exported them for your use.
