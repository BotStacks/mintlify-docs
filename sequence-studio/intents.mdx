Intents are used primarilly within the routing node in order to classify user input. They consist of a name and one or more utterances.

You can create a new intent from a routing node. Just select it and click the dropdown "Add your intents". At the bottom of that list is a button "Create new intent".

From there, you can add a name and one or more example utterances to help classify.
