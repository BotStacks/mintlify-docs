The AI Integration Node enables the connection to multiple external AI agents for initiating sub-conversations.

AI Integration Node can be placed anywhere in the conversation flow. When reached, it hands over the conversation to the selected third-party agent until the session ends, after which the flow resumes. 

Upon encountering the node, requests are sent to each external bot listed, and the one with the highest confidence score is chosen to continue the conversation. The list of available bots comes from all external provider bots.
