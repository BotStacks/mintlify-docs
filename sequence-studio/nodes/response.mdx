For Example, if you want to display a message in the chat, you connect the output of a text node to the input of the Response AI Node. This allows the Response AI Node to transmit the text message to the chat.

Additionally, you can set up canned responses, which are pre-defined messages that appear as buttons in the chat interface. These buttons give users options to select predefined responses, making interactions smoother.

Overall, the Response AI Node plays a crucial role in facilitating communication in your chat app by passing inputs from various nodes to the chat interface, ensuring seamless interaction between users and your chat application.
