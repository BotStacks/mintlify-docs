### 1. On Trigger

The On Trigger path activates when the user opens the chat widget or DM, making it suitable for sending a greeting message before the user says anything


### 2. On Message

The On Message path activates when the user sends the first message in the chat, allowing the user to initiate the conversation. 

**For Example**, `On Message` path can be used to create a bot like ChatGPT, where the bot remains silent until the user sends the first message to start the conversation

Overall, the Start Node creates the foundation for interaction, determining the path to follow based on how the conversation begins.
