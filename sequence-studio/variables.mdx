Variables are used to store state within a conversation. You can define set and read nodes within the designer workflow.

You can manage variables by going through an existing read or set node. Just select it and click the button "Manage variables" in the panel.

You can create and delete variables here.

### Reserved variables

- `chat_history`: Chat history is automatically set and updated as the conversation progresses.

<Note>
  We intentionally left the ability to manually set or append to the
  chat_history variable in a Set node available. Be careful not to set or append
  to it more than needed, as we are already handling it for you!
